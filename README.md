Exploring Clinical BERTâ€™s NLP Capabilities with Explainability Tools
This healthcare NLP project leverages advanced language representation models, specifically BIO+CLINICAL BERT, to enhance natural language processing tasks in the healthcare domain. Integrating state-of-the-art models, the project not only improves model accuracy but also prioritizes interpretability through the incorporation of explainability tools like LIME and SHAP. The application of these tools has revealed nuanced biases in the healthcare data, providing crucial insights for addressing ethical considerations and potential disparities in model predictions. By emphasizing both accuracy and interpretability, this project contributes to the development of more transparent and ethically sound AI solutions for healthcare applications.
